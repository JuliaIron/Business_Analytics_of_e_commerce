You should maintain a separate GitHub repo for this project with the following files:

    - Readme.md - This markdown will explain the data analysis workflow including the problem statement/ business the objective, data extraction, data wrangling, etc. Here you should explain the business analytic approach you used to solve the problem. Please be detailed in explaining the steps you followed. It is important to keep in mind that the document is written for the readers, who may or may not have the technical expertise with Python/SQL/Tableau.
    - Python File(If Any) - It can be either uploaded as a .ipynb file (Jupyter notebook) or .py file. The Python code should be well documented with comments, explaining the code, EDA operations, logic used - especially with data cleaning operations, and any assumptions followed in the model.
    - Dataset/datasets (provided to you)
    - Tableau workbook(If Any)
    - File containing SQL queries (If Any)

Some other tips

    - Pay attention to the naming convention: organize the files in folders with appropriate names
    - Do not include code snippets in the Readme.md file
    - Explain the business insights and the regression/classification model results
    - Explain the future score of work
    - Make daily commits to the repo
    
    
    
Some points to keep in mind while working on the tableau questions:

a) The plots should be well labelled briefly describing the purpose of the plot
b) Select the chart type that produces an effective outcome for a given scenario
c) Focus audience attention on the most important data
d) Use space, color and fonts appropriately
e) Use correct title for the plots.
f) Utilize formatted tooltips and descriptive titles
g) Format the axes wherever necessary
h) Use caption to add details wherever necessary
i) Use appropriate level of details with labels and color coding etc.
j) For the dashboard make sure that the information represented is clear and easy to understand. The user of the dashboard should be able to understand the purpose of the dashboard and should be able to make decisions looking at the plots presented.
k) You can also use filters wherever appropriate to give the user the flexibility to view different information easily
